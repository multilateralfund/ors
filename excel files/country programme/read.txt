After countries submitted the CP data, we extracted and consolidated the information in Excel and did the conversion from metric tonnes to ODP tonnes or CO2-eq and summarized in the following attachment:
•	CPData-Extraction-ALL
•	CPData-Extraction HFC
•	CPData-Extraction HCFC
In addition, I also attached two country programme documents submitted to the Executive Committee and two excel files with actual data submitted by the countries for your information:
•	8808
•	9108
•	Brazil-2021 CP Data
•	Mexico-2021 CP Data
